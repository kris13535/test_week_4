// EvenOdd Game
// -------------------------------

// Create a console program called EvenOdd Game

// Phase 1 (60 pts):

// 2 players play against each other.
// You get the player's names from the user.

// In each round, the game randomize a number between -5 and 13.
// If the number is even, the first player gets a point.
// If the number is odd, the second player gets a point.

// The winner is the first to get 3 points (Best of 5).


// For example:

// Round #1, random number is 8, Julia scored!
// Status: Julia 1, Avihu 0
// Round #2, random number is 10, Julia scored!
// Status: Julia 2, Avihu 0
// Round #3, random number is 5, Avihu scored!
// Status: Julia 2, Avihu 1
// Round #4, random number is 12, Julia scored!
// Status: Julia 3, Avihu 1

// Julia Wins!

// Phase 2 (30 pts):
// Enhance the EvenOdd game:

// Now enable to conduct a tournament.
// You can get from the user up to 7 players (and no less than 2).
// Now in each round the game picks up 2 players randomly to play.
// The game is playing rounds (each round with 2 randomized players) until someone reaches 3 wins (If, for example, it's best of 5).

// phase 3 (10 pts):
// The winner of the tournament should play against the Boss (Boss as the second player).
// The Boss have special ability: if the number is negative even, first player don't get the point, and the round is replayed again.

// 20 pts bonus:
// Use Git.
// Every phase in it's own branch
// Submit the git url

// Notes:

// - Player has name and score.
// - Best of 5 can be dynamic (Can be set to 7, so now the first to get 4 points wins)
// - Module your project!
// - Think of each entity responsibility: which action is done by which entity.
// - Use npm packages if you need
// - Clean Code!
// - Submit a working Code!
// - Small steps in code, big steps to reach 100‏
